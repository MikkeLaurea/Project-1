Done using hmtl, css and js

Was sick during the project so it gave me a bit of hard time but I managed to do my best.
My page is simple to-do list with very simple elements and nothing too fancy.

Instructions you can use this in my Netlify site and you can just typing your tasks and mark them done and delete them.
